    <h1>Main Components of a PC:</h1>
    <h3>1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The "brain" of the computer, responsible for performing most of the computations.</li>
        <li>Executes program instructions and controls all other components.</li>
        <li>Major manufacturers: Intel, AMD.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Random Access Memory (RAM)</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>Temporary memory used to store data and instructions currently in use.</li>
       <li>The data in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off.</li>
       <li>The more RAM you have, the more programs you can run simultaneously without slowing down.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or Solid State Drive (SSD)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>HDD: A storage device that uses spinning magnetic disks to store data. It is slower but cheaper and typically offers more storage capacity.</li>
        <li>SSD: A faster storage device that uses flash memory. It significantly speeds up your computer (faster program and operating system loading).</li>
        <li>The main circuit board that connects all components of the computer (CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Motherboard</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The main circuit board that connects all components of the computer (CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, etc.).</li>
        <li>Allows components to communicate and provides power distribution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Handles graphics rendering and displays images on the monitor.</li>
        <li>Can be integrated (built into the CPU) or discrete (separate card).</li>
        <li>Discrete GPUs are essential for gaming, 3D rendering, and video editing. Major manufacturers: NVIDIA, AMD.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides electrical power to all the computer's components.</li>
        <li>Converts electricity from the wall outlet into usable power for the PC.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. Computer Case</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Encloses and protects the internal components and aids with cooling.</li>
        <li>Houses components such as the motherboard, power supply, storage drives, and more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. Cooling Systems</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fans (coolers): Used to cool the CPU, GPU, or overall system.</li>
        <li>Liquid cooling (for high-performance PCs): A more complex system that reduces component temperatures during heavy loads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9. Monitor</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The display device that shows images, videos, and text.</li>
        <li>Key specifications: resolution, screen size, refresh rate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10. Input/Output Devices</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Keyboard and mouse: Primary input devices.</li>
        <li>Speakers or headphones: For audio output.</li>
        <li>Printer, scanner: For printing or scanning documents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>11. Network Interface Card (NIC)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows the computer to connect to the internet or local network.</li>
        <li>Can be integrated into the motherboard or installed as a separate card.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Software Components:</h2>

    <h3>1. Operating System (OS)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Manages the interaction between the user and the computer, controls hardware resources.</li>
        <li>Popular OS: Windows, macOS, Linux.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Drivers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Software that controls specific hardware components (e.g., graphics card, printer).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Software Applications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Programs: Text editors, graphic editors, web browsers, games, etc.</li>
        <li>Antivirus Software: To protect against malicious programs.</li>
    </ul>
